# loxone-config-launcher
This is a small Windows application that scans your Loxone Config installation location and gives you a drop down list of all of the Loxone Config versions that you have.
You can then pick a version and run it.

The idea behind the launcher is that we tend to run multiple different versions for clients, testing and our own installtions, 
so instead of having multiple icons on the desktop with weird naming conventions, we can just have one.

Here's how the app looks like:
